# Multimodal Depression Detection Net (MDDN Net)
This guide outlines the steps to perform multimodal depression detection using EEG and speech data. Follow these instructions in a step-by-step manner.

## Create virtual environment
First, set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
bash python3 -m venv .
```

## Activate virtual environment
```bash
bash source bin/activate
```
After activating the environment, run this command to install all necessary packages

```bash
bash python3 -m pip install e .
```

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing stage involves creating a consistent dataset and preparing the data for feature extraction.

First of all, let's make a folder containing aligned subject across all modalities (EEG/Speech).

run 
```bash
bash python3 preprocessing/create_dataset.py
```
This script finds subjects who have both EEG and audio recordings and creates a unified dataset. The output will confirm the number of aligned subjects and generate the split_dataset folder.

The output should show this:

EEG subjects: 53
Audio subjects: 52
✅ Aligned subjects: 38


### Audio Transcription
For transcribing audio, you can run 
```bash
bash python3 preprocessing/audio_transcription.py
```
This command transcribes all audio files (*.wav) for each subject and saves the transcription as a CSV file within their respective subject folders.

### Speech Preprocessing
For speech proecessing, you can run 

```bash
bash python3 preprocessing/speech_preprocessing.py
```
This script filters, resamples, segments (into 5-second clips), and normalizes the audio files.

### EEG Preprocessing
For EEG Preprocessing, you can run

```bash
bash python3 preprocessing/eeg_preprocessing.py
```

This command filters the EEG data and segments it into 10-second clips.

## Features Extraction
This section describes how to extract features from each modality using various models and techniques.

### EEG Features
a. CBRAMOD
For extracting CBRAMOD embeddings, we can run 

```bash
bash python3 extract_features_eeg/extract_cbramod.py --PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS cbramod_pretrained_weights/pretrained-weights.pth
```

Apart from using original pretrained weights, we also used pretrained weights trained from Mumtaz which we put it under name pretrained_weights2.pth, you can just put/moidfy the pretrained weights path. For details how to yield the pretrained_weights2, we follow the finetuning process on CBRAMOD Github page. Please refer to the original CBRAMOD GitHub website (https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod)/

```bash
bash python3 extract_features_eeg/extract_cbramod.py --PRETRAINED_WEIGHTS cbramod_pretrained_weights/pretrained-weights2.pth
```

b. LaBraM
```bash
bash python3 -m extract_features_eeg.extract_labram
```

c. Handcrafted features
```bash
bash python3 -m extract_features_eeg.extract_handcrafted_features
```

### Text Features
you can run:

```bash
bash python3 -m extract_features_text.extract_features_text
```
this will produce the embeddings from all models: XLNet, MpNet, Chinese BERT Base and Chinese Macbert. All will be saved under split_dataset/[subject_id]/text_embeddings_[model_name].npy

### Speech Features
For Speech features, you can run:
```bash
bash python3 -m extract_features_speech.extract_features_speech --feature_extractor [chinese_hubert / mfccs / xslr53] --encoder [cnn_bigru/ cnn_lstm/ cnn_bilstm/ cnn_gru/ cnn] --device [cpu / gpu]
```

Special for speech handcrafted features, you can run:
```bash
bash python3 training_module/handcrafted_feature_speech/cnn_bigru.py 
```

```bash
bash python3 training_module/handcrafted_feature_speech/cnn_bilstm.py 
```

```bash
bash python3 training_module/handcrafted_feature_speech/cnn_bigru.py 
```

The handcrafted-feature extraction is performed on-the-fly during training. This is done to ensure proper standardization, as some features have different value ranges and need to be scaled consistently across the dataset.

## Unimodal Detection
For unimodal detection you can run 
python3 -m training_module.unimodal_detection --config training_module/config.json

the confing.json contains any hyperparameters you can change:

```json
json {
    "dataset_class": "UnimodalDataset",
    "classifier": "bigruattention",
    "embedding_filename": "audio_xslr_encoded_bigru.npy",
    "base_dir": "split_dataset",
    "device": "cpu",
    "save_pred": "results/speech_predictions.json",
    "input_size": 256,

    "hyperparameters": {
        "learning_rate": 0.005,
        "epochs": 70,
        "hidden_dim": 1024,
        "batch_size": 8
    }
}
```

Classifiers Options:
1. bigruattention
2. lstm_fc
3. convpoolclassifier
4. bilstm_fc 

embedding_filename: embeddings/features file name based on the name you saved previously

device options: cpu or gpu

input size: you can change depends on the size of the features/embeddings


## Multimodal Detections
After unimodal detection, the results are saved as JSON files (e.g., eeg_predictions.json, text_predictions.json, and speech_predictions.json). It is important to note that each JSON file contains the predictions for a single model run, based on the specific feature extraction and classifier combination used.


We would need to slightly procses them to .txt to a prefered format by running:

```bash
bash python3 -m results/processing_results.py results/
```
With the processed prediction files, you can perform multimodal detection using one of these fusion strategies:

1. Majority voting (Mean)
```bash
bash python3 -m multimodal_detection.majority_voting                               
```

2. Bayesian Fusion
```bash
bash python3 -m multimodal_detection.bayesian_fusion                               
```

3. Weighted Averaging
```bash
bash python3 -m multimodal_detection.weighted_averaging                            
```

The scripts for Bayesian Fusion and Weighted Averaging include user configurations to specify modalities and weights. All final results are saved in the results/ folder.
