"""Handcrafted speech feature utilities (legacy helper module).

Provides standalone functions for extracting 46 prosodic/MFCC features
from audio segments.  These functions mirror the logic in
:mod:`lib.feature_extraction.speech.extract_handcrafted_features_speech`
and are kept here for backwards compatibility.

Features extracted per segment (46 total):

* Energy, F0 mean, RMS, pause rate, phonation time, speech rate (6)
* MFCC coefficients 1–40, mean across frames (40)
